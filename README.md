# 180-websites

This is an attempt to recreate Jennifer Dewalt's experiment 180 websites in 180 days for myself. Here's a link to an interview about 
her project:http://ihadtendollars.com/interviews/jennifer-dewalt.html. I simply do not want to do a 100 days of code challenge. I wanted
to focus on the mastery of one skill which in this case is CSS. I find that I learn a lot more from project base work and repetition
than just trying to randomly learn 5 different skills at once. My hopes are within the next 30 days I will be at least a intermediate 
CSS zen master. For 30 days I will recreate about 30 different webpages from the CSS Zen Garden site. At the end of the 30 days 
if I feel that my skills are adequate I will move on to 30 days of Javascript basics. And so on and so on.
